It is really good for the world but in deep the technology itself displacing the peoples jobs. Those who have manufacturing roles in the factory they can be jobless anytime. Industries are adopting/investing on technology like AI, Robotics and 3D-Printing; they are investing a lots of money to these types of technology and because of their investment they made their products so much more expensive to cover their business investment. To sifting toward the tech based works it requires a new skillfull peoples, which means the current employees may lack and create a gap that needs training and specialized skilled person to the industry, to work on that  technology properly. </p>
